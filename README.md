# cthulhu

# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A choose-your-own-adventure type game inspired by the tabletop RPG Call of Cthulhu. The user will choose between a series of choices, which will return an outcome based on their decisions.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I do not have any questions currently, but will definitely have some soon after starting the project.
