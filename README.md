# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A choose-your-own-adventure type game inspired by the tabletop RPG Call of Cthulhu. The user will choose between a series of choices, which will return an outcome based on their decisions.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I do not have any questions currently, but will definitely have some soon after starting the project.

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Haunting (based on the campaign scenario title)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A one-player digital version of a tabletop RPG, Call of Cthulhu. The computer asks the player to choose from a series of decisions and prints the outcomes of the string of decisions the player chooses to make. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will run like a visual-novel game but with tabletop elements. The user can make a character at the start, rolling dice to figure out their stats. After character creation, the computer gives the player a series of decisions and prints an outcome based on those decisions. For example, if the player is walking through a forest, they can choose to stay on the path or stray from it. If straying from the path, the player would have to make a required listen roll. If they fail the listen roll, they will be attacked by a creature. A battle ensues and the player is provided their next steps of action from which they can choose from. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I wish to accomplish at least a simple choose-your-own-adventure game. Games like these always rely on past choices, which will make the coding process quite complex. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my game would be having multiple endings and multiple branching stories. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my game, combined with multiple endings and multiple branching stories, is making player choices actually make a difference. For example, story-driven games that give players choices usually point the player to a certain ending, but I wish to have more complexity than that. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step would be writing the story, then sketching the web of decisions and their outcomes. After the story aspect is done, I will look into Ren'Py because I think it would be the best engine to use.
